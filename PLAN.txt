GLOBAL ROOT DIR FILE:

Accessing the global filesystem requires the following:
	Access to the global root directory file
	A bit indicating whether all 16 ids have been allocated
	A counter indicating the first unallocated disk id

The global root directory file may live anywhere (perhaps the accessing
	client machine's own disk).


SHARED DISK CONFIG FILE:

A shared disk can be a part of:
	0 global filesystems (no dfs-cfg-cs244b found in root)
	n global filesystems (a single dfs-cfg-cs244b found in root)

The contents of the config file are as follows:
	For each global filesystem this disk is a part of:
		An 11-byte identifying name, a 4 bit ID specifying the disk ID in
		this filesystem.



DFS BOOT PROTOCOL:

mac:
	1. read the specified dfs root dir.
	2. identify the range of expected ids.

for each connected pi:
	mac->pi create empty config file (idempotent, does not overwrite existing).

	mac->pi here is the fs identifier
	mac->pi <fs identifying name>
	mac->pi do you have an id for this filesystem?
	pi->mac yes|no = resp1
	if(resp1 == yes) {
		
		great. indicate this pi is connected, boot done.

	} else if(resp2 == no) {

		mac->mac can we add a new disk to the fs? = resp2
		if(resp2 == yes) {

			mac->pi here is your identifier for this fs
			mac->pi <disk id>
			mac->mac update fs state to reflect new disk.

			indicate this pi is connected, boot done.

		} else if(resp2 == no) {

			mac->pi kill yourself (hang)

		} else {

			unreached
		}
		
	} else {

		corrupt pi kernel
	}
